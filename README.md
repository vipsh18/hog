Source Code for Berkeley's CS61A Hog project 

The course was not taken as part of Berkeley University's curriculum but rather self-undertaken as part of a skill enhancement course.

### About the game
A player and the computer roll a number of dice turn by turn, the first player out of these two whose total reaches 100 wins the game. There are different rules like pigging out if you ever get 1 in your rolls or getting free bacon, if you don't rolla die.

Clone the repository and run command python3 hog.py or python hog.py to play the game.
