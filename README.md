# hog
Source Code for Berkeley's CS61A Hog project 

The course was not taken as part of Berkeley University's curriculum but rather self-undertaken as part of a skill enhancement course.

### About the game
A player and the computer roll a number of dice turn by turn, the first player out of these two whose total reaches 100 wins the game. There are different rules like _pigging out_ if you ever get 1 in your rolls or _getting free bacon_, if you don't roll a die.

Clone the repository and run command ```python3 hog.py``` or ```python hog.py``` to play the game.
